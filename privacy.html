    <p id="personal-information-provided-by-you"><strong>Personal Information Provided by You.</strong> The personal

    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser
        and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.</em></p>
    <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information
      does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage
      information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language
      preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our
      Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and
      operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
    <p>Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.</p>
    <p>The information we collect includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information

        Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser
        type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps
        associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which

        dumps'), and hardware settings).</li>
      <li>Device Data. We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device

        information.</li>
      <li>Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be
        either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device
        you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data
        that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this
        information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device.
        However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li>

    <h2 id="what-legal-bases-do-we-rely-on-to-process-your-information">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS
      YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we
        have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply
        with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your
        rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</em><br>
      The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on
      in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your
      personal information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to
        use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more
        about <a href="#withdrawing-your-consent">withdrawing your consent</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is
        necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request
        prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably
        necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and
        fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the
        purposes described in order to:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services</li>
          <li>Analyse how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</li>
          <li>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities</li>
        </ul>
      <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for
        compliance with
        our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or
        defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
      <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to
        protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential
        threats to the safety of any person.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="when-and-with-whom-do-we-share-your-personal-information">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL
      INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or
        with the following categories of third parties.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</strong> We may share your data with
      third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents (<strong>'third parties'</strong>) who perform
      services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in
      place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that
      they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also
      not share your personal information with any organisation apart from us. They also commit to protect the data
      they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct.</p>
    <p>The categories of third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Website Hosting Service Providers</li>
      <li>Data Analytics Services</li>
      <li>Cloud Computing Services</li>
      <li>Communication &amp; Collaboration Tools</li>
      <li>Services that provide maps and location data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during
        negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our
        business to another company.</li>
      <li><strong>When we use Google Maps Platform APIs.</strong> We may share your information with certain Google
        Maps Platform APIs (e.g. Google Maps API, Places API). Google Maps uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell towers to
        estimate your location. GPS is accurate to about 20 meters, while Wi-Fi and cell towers help improve accuracy
        when GPS signals are weak, like indoors. This data helps Google Maps provide directions, but it is not always
        perfectly precise.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="do-we-use-cookies-and-other-tracking-technologies">5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?
    </h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your
        information.</em></p>
    <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when
      you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services,
      prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>
    <p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for
      analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your
      interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third
      parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored
      to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.</p>
    <p>Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in
      our Cookie Notice.</p>
    <h3 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h3>
    <p>We may share your information with Google Analytics to track and analyse the use of the Services. To opt out of
      being tracked by Google Analytics across the Services, visit <a
        href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. For more
      information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the <a
        href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy &amp; Terms page</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="how-long-do-we-keep-your-information">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes
        outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
      Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
      other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for
      longer than 1 year.</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
      anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
      stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
      further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
    <h2 id="how-do-we-keep-your-information-safe">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational
        and technical security measures.</em></p>
    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to
      protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
      secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
      guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
      unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
      modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
      personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a
      secure environment.</p>
    <h2 id="do-we-collect-information-from-minors">8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of
        age.</em></p>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we
      knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that
      you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we
      learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the
      account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any
      data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a
        href="mailto:burak@kmzboxes.info">burak@kmzboxes.info</a>.</p>

      feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
      browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and
      implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
      other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
      tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
      version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
    <h2 id="do-we-make-updates-to-this-notice">11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> <em>Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant
        laws.</em></p>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
      'Revised' date at the top of this Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may
      notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We
      encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
